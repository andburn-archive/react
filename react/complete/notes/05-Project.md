## Planning

1. Component Tree (Structure)
- Application State (Data)
- Components vs Containers

## Notes
- *arrow-functions* can add a blank argument, implying doesn't matter `a.map((_, i) => ...`
- returning `null` from a component is ok, nothing will be rendered
- boolean `props` need not be assigned `<Thing click={handler} activated />`, `activated prop is `true`
