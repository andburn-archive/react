## Webpack

- bundles and optimizes all your web assets (js, css, images etc.)
- works on a root entry file (e.g. app.js) analyzes all dependencies and bundles together in proper order
- use *loaders* to apply file dependent transformations
- *plugins* are used on the bundled output, i.e. globally, before it is written
